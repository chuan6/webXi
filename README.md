A Chrome extension. Help user analyze his/her web browsing history in Chrome.

User's web browsing history in Chrome is available to a Chrome extension via a set of APIs under `chrome.history`. Only read-only APIs are used here. Thus, the extension does NOT alter the user's history data.

Goal of the extension is to provide a dynamic graphical interface to the data, so that a user can easily "touch" and manipulate the history, and do interesting analysis in his/her needs.
